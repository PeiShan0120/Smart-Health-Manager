In response to the challenges of an aging society, this project focuses on continuous health monitoring for the elderly to enable early intervention and real-time remote monitoring. The goal is to develop an intelligent exercise monitoring system that tracks blood oxygen (SpO2), heart rate, and movement count. The system allows users to monitor their real-time status during exercise and adjust intensity accordingly. 
Using Raspberry Pi integrated with sensors, the system captures real-time exercise data, such as SpO2 levels, heart rate, and exercise duration, to assess the user's health condition. It estimates calorie consumption based on the data, enabling users to optimize exercise intensity for safety and effectiveness. Additionally, a warning notification feature alerts users if their heart rate exceeds safe limits, helping prevent dizziness or loss of consciousness.
